## Direct Sound Recording\(Updated Demo\)


</div>

### Description

ActiveX dll that encapsulates the Direct Sound Capture Buffer for capturing sound from your sound card. The dll also contains a secondary buffer to copy the capture buffer for playing and writing to file. This code is not commented but most of it was gleaned from Jack Hoxley at DX4VB and the DirectX 8 Visual Basic Documentation supplied with the DirectX 8 SDK. I would like to thank Jack Hoxley for his awesome tutorial that he wrote at http://www.dx4vb.da.ru. He used DX7.
 
### More Info
 
You need to have DirectX 8 installed to use this dll. You also need to include the dx8vb.dll if you distribute an app using this dll.
